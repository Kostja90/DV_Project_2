```

## Data introduction
As required, this task was an open one, so the students had to choose a specific topic on their own. Our Group did choose a task we found on https://www.kaggle.com. This task provided a dataset which in the original form should be used to predict 

```{r cars}
install.packages("wordcloud") # word-cloud generator
install.packages("RColorBrewer") # color palettes

require("wordcloud")
library("RColorBrewer")

```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
