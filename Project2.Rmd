# Introduction
As required, this task was an open one, so the students had to choose a specific topic on their own. Our Group did choose a dataset we found on https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/getting-dataset#subset. This subset Contains 10k Music files and is around 2GB big. The actual dataset is about 300GB big and has arround 1 MIllion entries, in this case songs. Besids the Analysis, the dataset contains also some Metadata, like Author, produced year etc. and finally music data in HDF5 format. The actual Provider of this data set is THE ECHO NEST (http://the.echonest.com). As provided by the information about the dataset, it is a result of an collaboration between THE ECHO NEST and LabROSA (https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu). 

Our goal in this Project is going to be an analysis of some songfiles that we prefer. Since all of the musicfiles are labeled with artist- and songnames as well as the year of production,  we can  find allmost every song eather on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com) or on Spotify (https://www.spotify.com/de/). First we are going to listen to some of the songs to find the ones that we prefer. Further, we are going to analyze that songs to have a good understanding of data that describes our preferation. Last we are going to predict some more songs that will be chosen randomly from the whole dataset. 

Alongside with the above analysis we also want to have some more general information about the artists and their songs. Therefore we are going to visualize some general information. 

# Handle the downloaded data
After downloading and unzipping the data, one can see two different folders. The first one, 'data', containing several other folders (data files for tracks whose hashes begin with) 'A' and 'B' which contain songfiles in HDF5 (Hirarchical Data Format 5) format. This format is a general format used in science for big datasets. The provided files contain some analysis, some metadata and some more information that is stored on MusicBrainz (https://musicbrainz.org), an open music encyclopedia. The second folder named 'AdditionalFiles' contains different metadata as either text or db file. This data is going to be used for first hands on the whole dataset, to get to know the dataset since it is accessable really simple and prevent some general information about it. To read both datafolders one should install some additional packages that we will mention later on. 

## Preprocess the Additional files

When accessing the data provided in 'AdditionalFiles' folder, one has to remove the Seperators \<SEP\> and replace those with a common seperator like ';' because R is used to a one byte seperator and therefor it is not possible to read a file with seperator \<SEP\>.

The following codechunk was only used to access the txt files and to load them into RStudio


```{r importShow , warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
location <- read.csv2('data/subset_artist_location.txt',sep = ';', header = FALSE, col.names = c('artistId', 'lat','lon',  'trackID', 'artistName'))

artists <- read.csv2('data/subset_unique_artists.txt',sep = ';', header = FALSE, col.names = c('artistId', 'V2', 'trackID', 'artistName'))

tags <- read.csv2('data/subset_unique_mbtags.txt',sep = ';', header = FALSE, col.names = c('tags'))

uni_terms <- read.csv2('data/subset_unique_terms.txt',sep = ';', header = FALSE, col.names = c('terms Unique' ))

tracks <- read.csv2('data/subset_unique_tracks.txt',sep = ';', header = FALSE, col.names = c('trackID','V2', 'artistName','songName'))

tracksPerYear <- read.csv2('data/subset_tracks_per_year.txt',sep = ';', header = FALSE,  col.names = c('Year', 'trackID', 'artistName','songName'))

```
# General information visualized

The following code loads the packages that are required to make a wordcloud. Furthermore we figured out, that the first wordcloud we created, had a very bad distribution. Mostly because of the most common words in english language. Therefor we cleaned our dataset from this words according to our findings and the wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English). Thus we used 'the','and' and 'a' to clean the dataset.

```{r wordclodArtist, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Load packages
library("NLP")
library("tm") # for text mining
library("SnowballC") # for text stemming
library("RColorBrewer") # color palettes
library("wordcloud") # word-cloud generator 

docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(as.String(artists$artistName)))

# Convert the text to lower case
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))

others <- c('the','and','a')

toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, " ", x))
for (i in 1:length(others)){
docs <- tm_map(docs, toSpace, others[i])
}

dtm <- TermDocumentMatrix(docs)
m <- as.matrix(dtm)
v <- sort(rowSums(m),decreasing=TRUE)
d <- data.frame(word = names(v),freq=v)

wordcloud(words = d$word, freq = d$freq, min.freq = 1, scale = c(3,0.2),
          max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
mtext('Artistnames', side = 2, line = 1, adj = 0.5) # title

head(d,8)
```

When looking at the plot above one can see, that the common artistnames are eather orchestr or John. Also there are some spanisch words like los, so one can see that this dataset consists not only out of english artist but also spanish artists. Some other names like Joe or King are also quite common used. To make some more assumptions and to get a better understanding of the wordcloud, the actual frequencies of the very frequent entries where provided in a table. Together with this table and the wordcloud one could have a better understanding of the distribution of the Artistnames in the given dataset. After a small search on the internet (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_given_names#Male_names_2) one can see, that John was one of the most common names in the 1990's. 

```{r}
tracksPerYear$artistName[tracksPerYear$Year >= 1990 & tracksPerYear$Year <= 2000]
```
After displaing the actual dataset and the entries of the artistnames between the years 1990 and 2000, the assumption made before should be declined. However one can see another common word in the displayed subset 'Los'. 
The final statement about this set can not be well desribed but could be seen as a description of the given dataset without any further evidence. One statemnet is still appropriate. This dataset is distributet (after cleaning the dataset), like the wordcloud  and the table of frequencies is displaying it.


Almost the same analysis we did on common songnames. However the common words in this case where not quit the same as in the script before. Finding the common songnames we had to plot the wordcloud as uncleaned version. Thus the cleaning with found words like 'the','version','and','from', 'feat' and 'album' created the followed wordcloud. Because we decided that those words don't contain a lot of information as well as they are common words in english language we cuted these word out of the provided dataset.

```{r wordcloudSongname, warning=FALSE }
# Load packages
library("NLP")
library("tm") # for text mining
library("SnowballC") # for text stemming
library("RColorBrewer") # color palettes
library("wordcloud") # word-cloud generator 

docs1 <- Corpus(VectorSource(as.character(tracks$songName)))

# Convert the text to lower case
docs1 <- tm_map(docs1, content_transformer(tolower))

others <- c('the','version','and','from', 'feat','album')
toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, " ", x))
for (i in 1:length(others)){
docs1 <- tm_map(docs1, toSpace, others[i])
}

dtm <- TermDocumentMatrix(docs1)
m <- as.matrix(dtm)
v <- sort(rowSums(m),decreasing=TRUE)
d <- data.frame(word = names(v),freq=v)

wordcloud(words = d$word, freq = d$freq, min.freq = 1, 
          max.words=100, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"), main = "TITL")
mtext('Songnames', side = 3, line = 0, adj = 0.5) # title

head(d,7)
```

Looking at the result one can see the frequently words 'you' and 'love'. Interpreting this result, it is clear that this dataset consists of Songnames that are more likely to handle Love and the counterpart of a Human, you. A general assumption could be made, that there are more songs handling Love, the counterpart of someone and the live, then about technic or traveling for example. However this assumption can not be completle prooven since this dataset does not represent all the songnames in the world. 


```{r worldmapArtist , warning=FALSE}
library(maps)
library(mapdata)
#library(eurostat)

# parse the lat and lon values of given set 
lon <- as.double(as.character(location$lon))
lat <- as.double(as.character(location$lat))

# delete all NaN
lon <- lon[!is.na(lon)]
lat <- lat[!is.na(lat)]

coordinates <- as.data.frame(cbind(lon, lat))

# take a closer look at europe 
#europe <- as.data.frame(cbind(lon = c(54.78333, 24.08464, -31.26192, 59.34569), lat = c(80.56667, 34.83469, 39.45479, 62.21215)))

map('world',c('.')) 
points(coordinates$lon, coordinates$lat, col = "red", cex = .1)

#x <- map('world', xlim = range(europe$lon), ylim = range(europe$lat), namefield = TRUE)
#x$names <- gsub("\\:.*","",x$names)

map(col = "grey80", border = "grey40", fill = TRUE,
  xlim = c(-25, 45), ylim = c(36, 70), mar = rep(0.1, 4))
points(coordinates$lon, coordinates$lat, col = "red", cex = .3)

```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
